# Pinpoint Map From List

This is a REALLY simple python script that utilizes a couple of libraries to create a pinpoint map.  Initially created for my neighbor to show where all of his Art projects are installed.

## Install

- Run `pip3 install staticmap geopy`
- Edit `address.lst` to have a single address per line.
- Run `python3 create_map.py`

This should create a `marker.png` file that can be used in a webpage.

## Notes

Feel free to edit `create_map.py` as you see fit.  I will work on improving inputs/outputs at a later time.
